# This is a https://stack.lol docker compose file.

# This docker compose file is a recipe to set up a status monitoring system to monitor your services.
# It uses Uptime Kuma as the status monitoring system and Directus as the headless CMS to manage the status pages, users, and notifications.
# It also uses Traefik as a reverse proxy to expose the services on a subdomain.
# SQLite is used as the database to store both the monitoring and the heartbeat data.
