  ### Features

  ### No vendor lock-in: Fully interoperable with any conforming platform

  It doesn't have to be Mastodon; whatever implements ActivityPub is part of the social network! [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/why-activitypub-is-the-future/)

  ### Real-time, chronological timeline updates

  Updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI via WebSockets. There's a firehose view as well!

  ### Media attachments like images and short videos

  Upload and view images and WebM/MP4 videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated like GIFs; normal videos loop continuously!

  ### Safety and moderation tools

  Mastodon includes private posts, locked accounts, phrase filtering, muting, blocking, and all sorts of other features, along with a reporting and moderation system. [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/)

  ### OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API

  Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider, so 3rd party apps can use the REST and Streaming APIs. This results in a rich app ecosystem with a lot of choices!
