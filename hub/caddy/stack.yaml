    - Can coordinate with other Caddy instances in a cluster
    - Multi-issuer fallback
    - Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) support
  - **Stays up when other servers go down** due to TLS/OCSP/certificate-related issues
  - **Production-ready** after serving trillions of requests and managing millions of TLS certificates
  - **Scales to hundreds of thousands of sites** as proven in production
  - **HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3** all supported by default
  - **Highly extensible** [modular architecture](https://caddyserver.com/docs/architecture) lets Caddy do anything without bloat
  - **Runs anywhere** with **no external dependencies** (not even libc)
  - Written in Go, a language with higher **memory safety guarantees** than other servers
  - Actually **fun to use**
