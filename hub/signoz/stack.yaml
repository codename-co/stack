  ### Features

  - Single tool for observability(logs, metrics, and traces)
  - Built on top of OpenTelemetry, the open-source standard which frees you from any type of vendor lock-in
  - Correlated logs, metrics and traces for much richer context while debugging
  - Uses ClickHouse (used by likes of Uber & Cloudflare) as datastore - an extremely fast and highly optimized storage for observability data
  - DIY Query builder, PromQL, and ClickHouse queries to fulfill all your use-cases around querying observability data
  - Open-Source - you can use open-source, our cloud service or a mix of both based on your use case
