  ### Features

  Mage is a hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. It combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility of notebooks with the rigor of modular code.

  - **Extract** and synchronize data from 3rd party sources.
  - **Transform** data with real-time and batch pipelines using Python, SQL, and R.
  - **Load** data into your data warehouse or data lake using our pre-built connectors.
  - **Run**, monitor, and orchestrate thousands of pipelines without losing sleep.
