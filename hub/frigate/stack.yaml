  A complete and local NVR designed for Home Assistant with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

  Use of a GPU or AI accelerator such as a Google Coral or Hailo is highly recommended. AI accelerators will outperform even the best CPUs with very little overhead.

  ### Features

  - Tight integration with Home Assistant via a custom component
  - Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
  - Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
  - Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
  - Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
  - Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
  - Records video with retention settings based on detected objects
  - 24/7 recording
  - Re-streaming via RTSP to reduce the number of connections to your camera
  - WebRTC & MSE support for low-latency live view
