  - **🤖 AI-Ready**: Native AI pieces let you experiment with various providers, or create your own agents using our AI SDK, and there is Copilot to help you build flows inside the builder.

  - **🏢 Enterprise-Ready**: Developers set up the tools, and anyone in the organization can use the no-code builder. Full customization from branding to control.

  - **🔒 Secure by Design**: Self-hosted and network-gapped for maximum security and control over your data.

  - **🧠 Human in the Loop**: Delay execution for a period of time or require approval. These are just pieces built on top of the piece framework, and you can build many pieces like that. 🎨

  - **💻 Human Input Interfaces**: Built-in support for human input triggers like "Chat Interface" 💬 and "Form Interface" 📝
