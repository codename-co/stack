  ## Features

  By centralizing common API functionality across all your organization's services, the Kong API Gateway creates more freedom for engineering teams to focus on the challenges that matter most.

  The top Kong features include:
  - Advanced routing, load balancing, health checking - all configurable via a RESTful admin API or declarative configuration.
  - Authentication and authorization for APIs using methods like JWT, basic auth, OAuth, ACLs and more.
  - Proxy, SSL/TLS termination, and connectivity support for L4 or L7 traffic.
  - Plugins for enforcing traffic controls, rate limiting, req/res transformations, logging, monitoring and including a plugin developer hub.
  - Plugins for AI traffic to support multi-LLM implementations and no-code AI use cases, with advanced AI prompt engineering, AI observability, AI security and more.
  - Sophisticated deployment models like Declarative Databaseless Deployment and Hybrid Deployment (control plane/data plane separation) without any vendor lock-in.
  - Native [ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller) support for serving Kubernetes.
