  BunkerWeb is a next-generation, open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF).

  As a comprehensive web server built on NGINX, it secures your web services with a "secure by default" approach. BunkerWeb integrates effortlessly into existing environments (Linux, Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes, etc.) as a reverse proxy and offers complete configurability through both CLI and an intuitive web UI to suit your specific needs. This makes cybersecurity simple and accessible.

  BunkerWeb includes essential security features in its core and supports easy expansion through a flexible plugin system.
