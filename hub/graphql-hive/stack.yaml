  ### Features

  ### Schema Registry

  GraphQL Hive offers 3 useful features to manage your GraphQL API:

  - **Prevent breaking changes** - GraphQL Hive will run a set of checks and notify your team via Slack, GitHub, or within the application.
  - **Data-driven definition** of a “breaking change” based on Operations Monitoring.
  - **History of changes** - an access to the full history of changes, even on a complex composed schema (Federation, Stitching).
  - **High-availability and multi-zone CDN** service based on Cloudflare to access Schema Registry

  ### Monitoring

  Once a Schema is deployed, it is important to be aware of how it is used and what is the experience of its final users.
