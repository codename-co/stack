  Our platform has been battle-tested for over a decade and continues to evolve to meet usersâ€™ needs for a powerful community platform. Discourse allows you to create discussion topics and connect using real-time chat, as well as access an ever-growing number of official and community themes. In addition, we offer a wide variety of plugins for features ranging from chatbots powered by [Discourse AI](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-ai/259214) to functionalities like SQL analysis using the [Data Explorer](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-data-explorer/32566) plugin.
