  Project Quay builds, stores, and distributes your container images.

  ### Features

  - **Store your containers securely**:
    Ensure your apps are stored privately, with access that you control. Quay is teamwork optimized, with powerful access controls.
  - **Build & deploy new containers easily**:
    Use Quay to automate your container builds, with integration to GitHub, Bitbucket, and more. Robot accounts allow you to lock down automated access and audit each deployment.
  - **Automatic Security Scanning**:
    Quay continually scans your containers for vulnerabilities, giving you complete visibility into known issues and how to fix them.
