  ### Features

  * A **multi-dimensional** data model (time series defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)
  * PromQL, a **powerful and flexible query language** to leverage this dimensionality
  * No dependency on distributed storage; **single server nodes are autonomous**
  * An HTTP **pull model** for time series collection
  * **Pushing time series** is supported via an intermediary gateway for batch jobs
  * Targets are discovered via **service discovery** or **static configuration**
  * Multiple modes of **graphing and dashboarding support**
  * Support for hierarchical and horizontal **federation**
