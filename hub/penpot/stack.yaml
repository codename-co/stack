  Penpot is the first open-source design tool for design and code collaboration. Designers can create stunning designs, interactive prototypes, design systems at scale, while developers enjoy ready-to-use code and make their workflow easy and fast. And all of this with no handoff drama.

  ### Features

  Penpot expresses designs as code. Designers can do their best work and see it will be beautifully implemented by developers in a two-way collaboration.

  ### Plugin system
  [Penpot plugins](https://penpot.app/penpothub/plugins) let you expand the platform's capabilities, give you the flexibility to integrate it with other apps, and design custom solutions.

  ### Designed for developers
  Penpot was built to serve both designers and developers and create a fluid design-code process. You have the choice to enjoy real-time collaboration or play "solo".

  ### Inspect mode
  Work with ready-to-use code and make your workflow easy and fast. The inspect tab gives instant access to SVG, CSS and HTML code.

  ### Self host your own instance
  Provide your team or organization with a completely owned collaborative design tool. Use Penpot's cloud service or deploy your own Penpot server.

  ### Integrations
  Penpot offers integration into the development toolchain, thanks to its support for webhooks and an API accessible through access tokens.

  ### What’s great for design
  With Penpot you can design libraries to share and reuse; turn design elements into components and tokens to allow reusability and scalability; and build realistic user flows and interactions.
