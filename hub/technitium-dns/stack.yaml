  ### Features

  - Works on Windows, Linux, macOS and Raspberry Pi.
  - Docker image available on Docker Hub.
  - Installs in just a minute and works out-of-the-box with zero configuration.
  - Block ads & malware using one or more block list URLs.
  - Supports working as an authoritative as well as a recursive DNS server.
  - High performance DNS server based on async IO that can serve millions of requests per minute even on a commodity desktop PC hardware (load tested on Intel i7-8700 CPU with more than 100,000 request/second over Gigabit Ethernet).
  - Self host DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, and DNS-over-QUIC DNS services on your network.
  - DNS-over-HTTPS implementation supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 transport protocols.
  - Supports DNS over PROXY protocol version 1 and 2 for both UDP and TCP transports.
  - Use public DNS resolvers like Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, and AdGuard with DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, or DNS-over-QUIC protocols as forwarders.
  - Support for latency based name server selection algorithm that works with concurrency feature for both recursive resolution and forwarders.
  - Advanced caching with features like serve stale, prefetching and auto prefetching.
  - Persistent caching feature that saves cache to disk when DNS server restarts.
  - DNS rebinding attack protection feature available with DNS Rebinding Protection App.
  - DNSSEC validation support with RSA & ECDSA algorithms for recursive resolver, forwarders, and conditional forwarders with NSEC and NSEC3 support.
  - DNSSEC support for all supported DNS transport protocols including encrypted DNS protocols.
  - DANE TLSA RFC 6698 record type support. This includes support for automatically generating the hash values using certificates in PEM format.
  - SVCB & HTTPS draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https record type support.
  - URI RFC 7553 record type support.
  - SSHFP RFC 4255 record type support.
  - CNAME cloaking feature to block domain names that resolve to CNAME which are blocked.
  - QNAME minimization support in recursive resolver RFC 9156.
  - QNAME case randomization support for UDP transport protocol draft-vixie-dnsext-dns0x20-00.
  - DNAME record RFC 6672 support.
  - ANAME proprietary record support to allow using CNAME like feature at zone apex (CNAME flattening). Supports multiple ANAME records at both zone apex and sub domains.
  - APP proprietary record support that allows custom DNS Apps to directly handle DNS requests and return a custom DNS response based on any business logic.
  - Support for features like Split Horizon and Geolocation based responses using DNS Apps feature.
  - Support for REGEX based block lists with different block lists for different client IP addresses or subnet using Advanced Blocking DNS App.
  - Primary, Secondary, Stub, and Conditional Forwarder zone support.
  - Static stub zone support implemented in Conditional Forwarder zone to force a domain name to resolve via given name servers using NS records.
  - Supports Catalog Zones RFC 9432.
  - Supports record aging where the records with expiry set are automatically removed from the zone.
  - Bulk conditional forwarding support using Advanced Forwarding DNS App.
  - DNSSEC signed zones support with RSA & ECDSA algorithms.
  - DNSSEC support for both NSEC and NSEC3.
  - Zone transfer with AXFR and IXFR RFC 1995 and DNS NOTIFY RFC 1996 support.
  - Zone transfer over TLS (XFR-over-TLS) RFC 9103 support.
  - Zone transfer over QUIC (XFR-over-QUIC) RFC 9250 support.
  - Support for zone validation using ZONEMD records RFC 8976 for Secondary zones.
  - Dynamic DNS Updates RFC 2136 support with security policy.
  - Secret key transaction authentication (TSIG) RFC 8945 support for zone transfers.
  - EDNS(0) RFC6891 support.
  - EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) RFC 7871 support for recursive resolution and forwarding.
  - Extended DNS Errors RFC 8914 support.
  - DNS64 function RFC 6147 support for use by IPv6 only clients using the DNS64 App.
  - Support to host DNSBL / RBL block lists RFC 5782.
  - Multi-user role based access with non-expiring API token support.
  - Self host your domain names on your own DNS server.
  - Wildcard sub domain support.
  - Enable/disable zones and records to allow testing with ease.
  - Built-in DNS Client with option to import responses to local zone.
  - Supports out-of-order DNS request processing for DNS-over-TCP and DNS-over-TLS protocols RFC 7766.
  - Built-in DHCP Server that can work for multiple networks.
  - IPv6 support in DNS server core.
  - HTTP & SOCKS5 proxy support which can be configured to route DNS over Tor Network or use Cloudflare's hidden DNS resolver.
  - Web console portal for easy configuration using any web browser.
  - Built in HTTP API to allow 3rd party apps to control and configure the DNS server.
  - Built-in system logging and query logging.
  - Open source cross-platform .NET 8 implementation hosted on GitHub.
